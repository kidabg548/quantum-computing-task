# Quantum Entanglement Playground

Welcome to the **Quantum Entanglement Playground**, a hands-on collection of quantum computing experiments built using **Qiskit**. This project explores fundamental quantum phenomena such as **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum measurement** through interactive simulation tasks and statistical verification.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates and visualizes key quantum mechanics concepts through four experiments:

1.  **Forced Superposition & Entanglement**
2.  **Entanglement Witness with Probabilistic Noise**
3.  **Opposite-Measurement Entanglement**
4.  **Quantum Coin Flip Game with Measurement Entanglement**

Each task is executed over hundreds or thousands of trials to gather meaningful measurement statistics. The project is built using **Python**, **Qiskit**, and **Matplotlib**, and runs in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setup Instructions

> âœ… Requires Python 3.7+, Qiskit, and Matplotlib.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib

# Quantum Circuit Experiments

This document outlines a series of quantum circuit experiments designed to explore fundamental quantum concepts like superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. The experiments are designed to be run using a quantum computing simulator like Qiskit.

## Running the Code

You can execute the code in the following environments:

*   **Google Colab (Recommended):** Provides a readily accessible environment with all necessary libraries pre-installed.
*   **Jupyter Notebook (Locally):** Requires installing the necessary libraries (e.g., Qiskit, NumPy, Matplotlib).
